# Mathematical Queuing Models and their application in everyday problems

Asatract: 

Have you considered how much time you spend in queues and traffic? Statistics show that the average person spends around five years of their lives waiting in queues.
In our research, we gain insight into the dynamics of queues and traffic flows using probability theory and stochastic processes. We used the obtained theory and data to develop computer programs to study the behaviour of two types of Markov queues, M/M/1 and M/M/k.


Our approach involved utilising Poisson processes to model localised traffic and the actions of cars on roadways. A developed Python program generates simulated traffic and presents visual animations of particle flow patterns. We can scrutinise
traffic behaviour and congestion by fine-tuning the program's parameters.


Furthermore, we introduced the height function that displays the number of particles that have successfully traversed the specified stages. Tracking and plotting pass-stage information provide a quantitative and visual representation of a systemâ€™s behaviour and performance.


Join us on this analytical journey where theory meets code and modelling reveals the operational principles driving traffic dynamics.
